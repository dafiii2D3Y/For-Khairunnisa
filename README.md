📝 The Message
"Wahai entitas biologis... Ingatlah, detik ini kau semakin dekat pada titik kesadaran bahwa tidur siang adalah bentuk tertinggi dari kebijaksanaan."

This project serves as a reminder that life—much like a thesis or a "skripsi"—is full of revisions, but still beautiful when shared with a bowl of Bakso and a little bit of optimism.
